### Fibonacci apples designs, by Henry Segerman http://segerman.org 
### 17/07/15

### This python code produces a design of apple logos for lasering on your macbook.
### The pattern includes an apple where the backlit apple logo is, so that the backlit apple
### fits into the pattern. REMEMBER TO DELETE THE CENTRAL APPLE BEFORE LASERING YOUR LAPTOP!

### Unfortunately, this code produces very large .eps files. Opening them in a vector graphics 
### program (e.g. Adobe Illustrator) takes a while, but then saving to .pdf makes the files
### much more manageable. For testing purposes, have the code generate a smaller number of apples.

### Process:
### 1) Play with the settings to get whatever effect you want. Don't use a design that has any apples
###    overlapping with the central apple logo, since you will likely end up lasering through the 
###    backlit apple logo that's already on your laptop.
### 2) Open the .eps file in a vector graphics program and set the artboard size to the 
###    dimensions of your laser etcher. Save a copy as a pdf.
### 3) Save a second copy of the file, having deleted the central apple and the border rectangle.
### 4) Position your laptop in the laser etcher using the first pdf (so you can use the non-cutting
###    "line things up" laser on the cutter to position the laptop correctly, matching with the 
###    border rectangle and the central apple)
### 5) If the central apple isn't lining up well with the border rectangle, play with the 
###    center_apple_offset variable below to shift them relative to each other. 
### 6) Once everything is lined up, switch to the second pdf (which won't laser through the backlit
###    apple and destroy your laptop).
### 7) For that matter, maybe it would be a good idea to put a small sheet of something durable over
###    the backlit apple logo before you laser anything.
### 8) Get the "material thickness" settings correct so that the laser focuses on the top surface of
###    your laptop. For mackbook airs, you will need to prop up the front so that the surface doesn't
###    slope.
### 9) Laser away!

### Use this code and the designs produced by it at your own risk. I take no responsibility if you 
### accidentally (or deliberately) destroy your laptop with lasers.
